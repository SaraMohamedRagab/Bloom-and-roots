              Our Story
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              Bloom & Root was born from a deep love of plants and a desire to share that passion with others. Our founder, Emma Chen, started the business from her small apartment, hand-selecting each plant and delivering them herself to local customers. As word spread about the exceptional quality and care of our products, we grew to become the thriving online and brick-and-mortar business we are today.

              Our Philosophy
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              At Bloom & Root, we believe that everyone deserves to have a piece of nature in their home. Plants aren't just beautiful decorations; they're living beings that improve air quality, reduce stress, and create a sense of peace and tranquility in any space.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Each plant and bouquet that leaves our shop is carefully selected and nurtured. We work with responsible growers who share our commitment to sustainable practices. Our pots are sourced from talented artisans, and many of our supplies are locally made.
            </p>
